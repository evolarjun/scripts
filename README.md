A few little scripts to keep around

Nothing special here at the moment

- d2l - view column-delimited data fixed-width using less -S
- d2f - just covert to tab to fixed-width data without piping to less
- fagrep - search FASTA files a la grep

Install to ~/bin with 
make install

Install somewhere else with
